# Steam Widget

A lightweight widget for your personal website that displays the last game you played on Steam along with your hours.
⚠️ Note: Your Steam profile must be public for this to work.

## Example:

<script src="https://strawberrysnails.github.io/widgets/js/steam-widget.js?steamid=76561198243819620"></script>

# How to use

## 1. Simple installation:

Paste this code into your website where you want the widget to appear:
```<script src="https://strawberrysnails.github.io/widgets/js/steam-widget.js?steamid=YOUR_STEAM_ID_HERE"></script>```

Replace YOUR_STEAM_ID_HERE with your Steam 64-bit ID.

Find your Steam ID here: [steamid.io](https://steamid.io/)

## 2. Optional: Custom Styling
You can change the widget’s look with CSS. Add this to your site’s stylesheet or inside a <style> tag:
```
<style>
  /* Change background and text color */
  .steam-widget {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #ffcc00;
    font-family: "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 1rem;
  }

  /* Customize the strong elements */
  .steam-widget strong {
    color: #00ffcc;
  }
</style>
```

Tip: You can target .steam-widget to change fonts, colors, spacing, and more.
